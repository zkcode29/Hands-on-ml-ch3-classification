## Hands-on-ml-ch3-classification


This repository contains 4 hands-on machine learning projects completed as part of my internship at **ARCH Technologies**. Each project was implemented using **Python, Scikit-learn, and Google Colab** with step-by-step explanations, visualizations, and real-world datasets.
